  	<p>Hey! My name is Ryan Davis. While I’m always entertaining myself by challenging myself and trying new things, I like to specialize in pre-production and rigging for animation. I have a BA in Art Practice from UC Berkeley. I’ve worked on short films, VR games, and educational content for 3D and art courses.</p>
